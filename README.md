This repo contains a transcript of the C _Program for Arithmetic Coding_ found in **Witten Ian H., Neal Radford M., Cleary John G. (1987). _Arithmetic coding for data compression_. Communications of the ACM, 30(6), 520â€“540. doi:[10.1145/214762.214771](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/214762.214771),** as well as a slightly modified version.

The `verbatim` folder hosts the original, (hopefully) unchanged files as they appear in the paper, while the root contains my modified, (hopefully) compileable files.

(For a similar project implemented in C++, see [dmitrykravchenko2018/arithmetic_coding](https://github.com/dmitrykravchenko2018/arithmetic_coding).)
